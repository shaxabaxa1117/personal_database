# How to combine habits

The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: 
```ad-note

1. After **[CURRENT HABIT]**, I will **[HABIT I NEED]**. 

2. After **[HABIT I NEED]**, I will **[HABIT I WANT]**.

```

We should know how to combine the things we need to do and things that we want to do.  After response there should be reward. The reward enables us having craving.  The cue should appear from your environment or we should create it by ourselves
