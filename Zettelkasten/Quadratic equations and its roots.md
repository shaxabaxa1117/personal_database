$$ax^{2}+bx+ c = 0$$
The is quadratic equation 

We can assume the it as function. We must find zeros of the function. 
$$x^{2} =y$$

so `x square` equals has two solutions.

$$x^{2} = A$$
 - If A > 0 then there 2 solutions for this equations

$$x = \pm\sqrt{ A }  $$
 - If A = 0 then there is only one solution
$$x^{2} = 0$$
 - If A < 0 then there is no solution

There is also non-full quadratic equation
$$Ax^{2}+Bx = 0$$

Here is the solution for this 
$$x(Ax+B) = 0$$
$$x_{1}= 0$$$$x_{2} = Ax+B$$

## Full quadratic equation



$$ax^{2}+bx+ c = 0$$
 - This also can be written like this:
$$a(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})= 0$$

- There are 2 main ways of solving this kind of equation 
	1) ![[Discriminant]]
	2) ![[Theorem of Vieta]]
