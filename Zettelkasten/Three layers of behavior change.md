![[Pasted image 20240324142643.png | 400]]

The first level is an outcomes - this layer is about changing <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">results and goals .</mark>
The second is processes - this is about changing your<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> habits and system </mark>
The third is identity - changing <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">desire and belief</mark>

```ad-note

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
```

There are two types of people who use this graph in their own way.
```ad-important

True behavior change is identity change.
([[Identity-based habit ]])
```


```ad-failure

[[Outcome-based habit]] is not the thing that we should follow.
```

[[Identity-based habit ]]
