# 👨‍💻Enum

```ad-note
Enum data has `No` type , `No` value. It is literally nothing.
But it has index which is intiger

However it is realy practical. 
Instead of identifying the (for exmaple) String with value 'red', we can use enum.
Code looks cleaner.
For instance, you can use enum for comparison.
