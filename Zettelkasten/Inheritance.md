# Inheritance

Inheritance let us complement the class with others. So  parent class and child classes appear.

```ad-tip
The every class we create extends from Object class.

```dart

class MyClass extends Object{
...
}

//! extends Object is written by default ]
```

It takes all methods of the parent class. It is quite  uncomfortable as i can not get the mehtod of the class without getting the properties.
