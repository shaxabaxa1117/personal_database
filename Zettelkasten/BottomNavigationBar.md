I created special file where the description of `BottomNavigationBar`'logic is written. 
I used [convex package](https://pub.dev/packages/convex_bottom_bar) as it is more convenient.

convex has `onTap(int index){ }` property 
index here is the button from `items: TabItem` list. So if the first button is tapped than the index is 0. (As long as list starts with 0)

- In stateful widget we create variable `selectedPage`. 
- We create list of the content(other pages that we want to move on) `_pageList`.
- And we also create state function `changeIndex`.

## The logic

Whenever we click on the buttons of `BottomNavigationBar`  the `index` parameter of `onTap` property is always changed

we have got  `changeIndex` function which changes our `selectedPage` to the `index` whenever we type on the buttons. in the body we use `_pageList[selectedPage]` to finally change the content.

Example : we click on the second button : the `index` changes to 1 : function `changeIndex` changes value `selectedPage` to the `index` : so now `selectedPage` is 1: in the body the page of `_pageList[selectedPage]`  will be declared

We must change our code as I understood that the first page is not going to react with previous code 

But the code below solves the problem!!!
Here we see that `curentPage` get the page from `_pageList` and then it is shown in `body:`

```ad-important

Change the initialPage to the one we want to 
```
