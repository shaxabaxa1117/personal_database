Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
Whenever we create class we (by default) declare [[Constructer]]



```ad-important
CREATING NEW CLASS MEAN CREATING NEW DATA `TYPE`

```

So there are 4 principles of it
They are:

[[Inheritance]] 

[[Polymorphism]]

[[Encapsulation]]

[[Abstraction]]
