# 👨‍💻try-catch

The idea is to prevent appearing an error in program and show it in the console instead for developers.

`int.parse` assure us that a is typed as int. But in the main() there no integer in string so the program throw an error but with `try` we check the code and with `catch` send something to the console that the error was found (mainly we send `error`)
