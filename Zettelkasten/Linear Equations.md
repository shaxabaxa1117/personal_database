```ad-note

The main idea of linear equation is to find unknow value of X
```
- First and foremost, we must have all X's to the right (or left), then find X

---

Sometime we have got X in our denominator, and we must get rid of it as soon as we can. The best way is to divide all fraction to the X existing denominators in fractions.

Here is an example

```ad-seealso
However we may see here that we can NOT get 1 as a value of X as long as denominator can become 0.

As we know, we can NOT divide anynumber by 0 as it is considered to be error

```
