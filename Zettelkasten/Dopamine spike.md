# Dopamine spike

![[Pasted image 20240404051021.png | 300]]

- Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time. 
- The next time around (B), dopamine rises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spike leads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you already expect the reward. 
- However, if you see a cue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). 
- The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified and dopamine rises as a craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the reward does not come as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to drop. Finally, when the reward comes a little later than you had hoped, dopamine spikes again. It is as if the brain is saying, “See! I knew I was right. Don’t forget to repeat this action next time.”
