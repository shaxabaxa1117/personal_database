# üìèTheme : TYPES OF NUMBERS


- **NATURAL NUMBERS** 
	The set of all positive numbers starting at 1 that have no fractional or decimal part; also called whole numbers.
	 Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . (<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">0 IS NOT NATURAL NUMBER BUT WHOLE NUMBE</mark>)
- **WHOLE NUMBERS**
	The set of all natural numbers and 0.
	 Examples: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . 
- **INTEGERS**
	The set of all whole numbers, including negative natural numbers.
    Examples: . . . -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . .

    <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a</mark>  is numerator (—á–∏—Å–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å)
	
	<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">b</mark> is denominator (–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å)

- **IRRATIONAL NUMBERS**
    The set of all numbers that are not rational numbers. These are numbers that cannot be written by dividing one integer by another.
