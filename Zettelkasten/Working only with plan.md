# 📓Working only with plan


```ad-note
It is essential to have plan before starting as we can see [[Planning and its importance]]

But we should not forget about doing everything in order. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Do exactly how it is written in plan.</mark> Only after comliting it move to other tasks that you wnated to do or postpone it for tomorow(or other days)

```
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The rule 10/90</mark> has the same logic
