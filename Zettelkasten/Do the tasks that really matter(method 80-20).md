# 📓Do the tasks that really matter

When we do the task we spend most of our time doing the thing that are easy and do not have any importance to our achievements. *80 / 20* it show that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">20%</mark> of our work is 5-10 times more valuable that 80%.

We should not have habit like doing tiny tasks that seems to be important but in the reality we should do the most important things

20% of our work gives us 80% of our results
