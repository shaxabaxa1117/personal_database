- **Two Modes**: Brain toggles between **Focused** (intense, familiar tasks) and **Diffuse** (relaxed, big-picture ideas).
- **Pinball Analogy**:
    - **Focused**: Close bumpers, smooth paths for known problems.

- **Key Point**: Canâ€™t be in both modes at once; switch for creative problem-solving.
- **Use**: Focused for deep work, diffuse for innovation.
