# Why identity-based habit is the best option

 For instance : you want to quit the smoking
 - If you lead outcome-based habit you will say :
 ```ad-note

'I don't want to smoke. I intend to quit it'
```

- If you lead identity-based habit you will say : 

```ad-note

'i don't smoke. I am not smoker'
```


Other examples : 
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. 
- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. 
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

Once you  understand Identity-based habit you can be motivated in the whole process of creating it.
