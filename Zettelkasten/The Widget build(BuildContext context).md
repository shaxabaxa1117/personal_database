# The Widget build(BuildContext context)


```ad-summary

The Widget build(BuildContext context) method is the most important method in a Flutter widget. It is called whenever the widget needs to be rebuilt, such as when the state of the widget changes or when the parent widget is rebuilt.

The BuildContext argument is a handle to the location of the widget in the widget tree. It can be used to access information about the widget's parent and children, as well as the overall state of the application.
