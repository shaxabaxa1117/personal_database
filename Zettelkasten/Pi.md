```ad-summary
The value of Pi (œÄ) is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter and is approximately equal to¬†**3.14159**. In a circle, if you divide the circumference (is the total distance around the circle) by the diameter, you will get exactly the same number.

$$\frac{C}{d} = \frac{2\pi R}{2R} = \pi$$

# Relation of Pi to angle


$$\pi = 3.14\dots radians$$
$$1~radian = 57.3\dots^\circ$$
# Radian to angle - angle to radian
$$\alpha^\circ = \alpha^{rad}*\frac{180}{\pi}$$
$$\alpha^{rad} = \alpha^\circ * \frac{\pi}{180} $$
