The main understanding of the trigonometry comes from angle, and it is crusiail to understand the ratio of an angle to a triangle.

There three types of ration in triangle:
$$\sin\alpha $$
$$\cos\alpha$$
$$\tan\alpha$$
$$\cot\alpha$$

The idea of alfa is to show from which angle we are looking to the ratio.
