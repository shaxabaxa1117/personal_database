# THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

The main idea of this note is that there are 4 : 


<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">How to Create a Good Habit</mark>
- The 1st law (Cue): [[Make it obvious]].  
- The 2nd law (Craving): [[Make it attractive]]. 
- The 3rd law (Response): [[Make it easy]]. 
- The 4th law (Reward): [[Make it satisfying]].

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">How to Break a Bad Habit</mark> 

- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. 
- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. 
- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. 
- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying



<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself:</mark> 
1. How can I make it obvious? 
2. How can I make it attractive? 
3. How can I make it easy? 
4. How can I make it satisfying?
