# Pointing-and-Calling

You can recognize you actions by Pointing-and-Calling.
How it works:
You start say what exactly you are doing. 
Example: 
'I wake up,  and now i meditate then drink coffee or tea as an reward'
Actually we have been using the method for long time.
Before leaving we say: "Keys are with me, phone is in my pocket, bag is here, card is hear and so on" , don't we?)
```ad-note
m. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.


```

```ad-example
“I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”

```


The more we are aware about our habits, the better we control the, so this approach can help us to implement great habits.
