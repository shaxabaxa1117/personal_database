```ad-note

If we enter the kitchen and see cookies on the table. What will we do ?
Right, we will definitely grab one.
- Not because we are hungry, but rather we are **under influence of envirinment** 
```

It works  unconsciously and we barely can control it,<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> if we don't pay specific attention to them </mark>

As an example :
- you are most likely to read the book if it is on your desk. 
- you are most likely to drink more water if the water cooler is nearby your workspace
```ad-important
We do not control the product
vice versa
The poduct control us

```

Interestingly, the best soda companies( like Coke, Fanta, Pepsi, Sprite) set their product to eye level vision of the fridge. Because of ads( that we watch every day, even while passing over TV) and position of it, we <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">automatically </mark> take the one which is more advertised or the one which seems obvious for us

```ad-note
VISION is the most powerful tool of human being. It provides abilty to sence the environment. 

```

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">That means, we can control the environment </mark>


```ad-note

It‚Äôs easy **not** to practice the guitar when it‚Äôs tucked away in the closet. It‚Äôs easy **not** to read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It‚Äôs easy **not** to take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are **easy to ignore**.
```

```ad-hint
Change the enviroment if you want to change the atitude toward the action or habit.

Example : 

Don't study in the room where you play video games

```
