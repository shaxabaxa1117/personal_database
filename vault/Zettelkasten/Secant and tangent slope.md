## Secant slope

![[Pasted image 20250405152756.png]]

$$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{f(x_1 + h) - f(x_1)}{h} $$

```ad-important

In geometry, a line joining two points of a
curve is a secant to the curve. Thus, the average rate of change of ∆í from x1 to x2 is identical
with the slope of secant PQ. Let‚Äôs consider what happens as the point Q approaches the
point P along the curve, so the length h of the interval over which the change occurs
approaches zero. We will see that this procedure leads to defining the slope of a curve at a
point.
