# Brain Basics for Learning

- **Brain Overview**:
    - Weighs 3 lbs, consumes 10x energy per weight than body.
    - Most complex device in universe, holds thoughts, hopes, fears in neurons.
- **Cognitive Abilities**:
    - Chess/math require years of practice; computers outperform humans.
    - Everyday tasks (seeing, hearing, running) are complex, beyond current computers.
- **Unconscious Processing**:
    - Brain evolved to navigate environments; most work is unconscious.
    - Unconscious mind influences thoughts, memory, emotions, motivation.
    - We’re aware of only a tiny fraction of brain activity.
- **Brain Imaging**:
    - Resting state shows **default mode network** (red-orange areas), active when not interacting with world.
    - Blue areas active during interaction, off during rest.
    - Brain areas correlate in activity patterns, revealing dynamic networks.
- **Synapses & Learning**:
    - Brain has ~1 quadrillion synapses storing memories.
    - Connectivity is dynamic; synapses form/disappear constantly, even in mature brains.
    - New imaging shows synapses (<1 micron) change post-learning/sleep, stabilizing memories.
    - Sleep upgrades brain, integrating daily experiences (Shakespeare’s “knitting” analogy).
- **Takeaway**:
    - Leverage unconscious mind and sleep to enhance learning/problem-solving.
