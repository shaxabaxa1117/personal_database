```ad-important

1% worse every day for one year. 0.99^365 = 00.03 



1% better every day for one year. 1.01^365 = 37.78
```
 




```ad-note

if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.
```

```ad-fail

But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.
```
