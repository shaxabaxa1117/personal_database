# üë®‚ÄçüíªAsynchronous programing in Dart



There are two main terms 
Process and Stream.

They both are different.

Process is what is happening inside the code with other process. There can be millions of processes that are working at the same time. ( Just like our computers working right now). 
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Process</mark> knows NOTHING about other processes but it can send it  own commands to them.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Streams</mark> execute the parallel code.

The more streams the technology has the faster it will work.

The mobiles has a lot of stream so we can apply for each stream to make performance of our app better
We can not control all process but you can control the streams in it

Asynchronous programing and streams are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">different
</mark>

Streams give us ability to do 2 things at the same time (parallel)

Asynchronous programing can execute code than stop for certain period while other code is executing and continue the code after // bad definition
