# the Diderot Effect


Diderot was really  poor writer. He could not afford the wedding of his daugther. However everything changed when he sold his library to Catherine the Great. He had not even thought that this will change his whole life. After he had paid for this daughter's wedding, he started buying even more, and this became a habit.

This story is essential as it illustrates us how we can stack habits. Once he had bought new possession, he moved to another one. Endless liner.
 # Habit stacking

 ```ad-important
The habit stacking formula is:

"After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

```

In the [[Habit stacking examples]] it is shown how habits stacking is crucial.
