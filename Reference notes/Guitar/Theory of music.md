We recommend that you memorize the letter names of the open strings
(E, A, D, G, B, E, from 6th to 1st) so that you‚Äôre not limited to referring to
them by number. An easy way to memorize the open strings in order is
to remember the phrase <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">‚ÄúEddie Ate Dynamite; Good Bye, Eddie.‚Äù</mark>
